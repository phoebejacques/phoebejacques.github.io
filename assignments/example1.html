				Frog ran up the path to Toad’s house.<br>
				He knocked on the front door. <br>
				There was no answer. <br>
				“Toad, Toad,” shouted Frog, “Wake 
				up. It is spring!” <br>“Blah,” said a voice 
				from inside the house.<br> 
				“Toad, Toad,” cried Frog. 
				“The sun is shining! 
				The snow is melting. 
				Wake up!” <br>“I am not here,” said the 
				voice. <br>
				Frog walked into the house. 
				It was dark. 
				All the shutters were closed. <br>“Toad, 
				where are you?” called Frog. <br>
				“Go away,” said the voice from a 
				corner of the room. <br>
				Toad was lying in bed. 
				He had pulled all the covers over his 
				head. <br>
				Frog pushed Toad out of bed. 
				He pushed him out of the house and 
				onto the front porch. <br>
				Toad blinked in the bright sun. <br>
				“Help!” said Toad. 
				“I cannot see anything.” <br>
				“Don’t be silly,” said Frog. 
				“What you see is the clear warm 
				light of April. <br>
				And it means that we can begin a 
				whole new year together, Toad, 
				Think of it,” said Frog. <br> </p>
				<blockquote>“We will skip through the meadows 
					and run through the woods and <br>swim in 
					the river. 
					In the evenings we will sit right here <br>
					on this front porch and count the stars.”</blockquote>
				 
				<p>“You can count them. Frog,” said 
				Toad. “I will be too tired. <br>
				I am going back to bed.” <br>
				Toad went back into the house. <br>
				He got into the bed and pulled the 
				covers over his head again. <br>
				“But, Toad,” cried Frog, “you will 
				miss all the fun!” <br>“Listen, Frog,” said 
				Toad. <br>
				“How long have I been asleep?” <br>
				“You have been asleep since 
				November,” said Frog. <br>
				“Well then,” said Toad, “a little 
				more sleep will not hurt me. <br>
				Come back again and wake me up at 
				about half past May. <br>
				Good night, Frog.” <br>
				“But, Toad,” said Frog, “I will be 
				lonely until then.” <br>
				Toad did not answer. <br>
				He had fallen asleep. Frog looked at 
				Toad’s calendar. <br>
				The November page was still on top. <br>
				Frog tore off the November page. <br>
				He tore off the December page. <br>
				And the January page, the February <br>
				page, and the March page. <br>
				He came to the April page. 
				Frog tore off the April page too. <br>
				Then Frog ran back to Toad’s bed. <br> </p>
				<blockquote>“Toad, Toad, wake up. It is May 
				now.” </blockquote>
				<p>“What?” said Toad. 
				“Can it be May so soon?” <br>
				“Yes,” said Frog. <br>
				“Look at your calendar.” <br>
				Toad looked at the calendar. 
				The May page was on top. <br>“Why, it 
				is May!” said Toad as he climbed out 
				of bed. <br>
				Then he and Frog ran outside to see 
				how the world was looking in the 
				spring.
